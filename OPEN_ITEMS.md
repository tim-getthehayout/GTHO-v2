### OI-0046 — App Header Missing "Get The Hay Out" App Name
**Added:** 2026-04-14 | **Area:** v2-build | **Priority:** P3
**Checkpoint:** post-GH-5
**Status:** open

The app header (redesigned in GH-5) shows the operation name and farm picker but no longer displays the app name "Get The Hay Out" above the operation name. v1 has this and it should carry over to v2 — it's the app identity and helps orient the user, especially on first load.

**Fix:** Add "Get The Hay Out" as a small text label above the operation name in `src/ui/header.js`. Should be visually secondary (smaller/lighter than the operation name) so it doesn't compete with the contextual info.

### OI-0040 — Move Wizard / Event Close Missing Residual Height + Recovery Day Inputs
**Added:** 2026-04-14 | **Area:** v2-build | **Priority:** P2
**Checkpoint:** post-CP-57
**Status:** open — DESIGN REQUIRED, do not build

V2_UX_FLOWS.md §1 (move wizard Step 3) and §9 (event close) specify residual height, recovery min/max day inputs on the close-out panel. These fields are not present in `src/features/events/move-wizard.js` or `src/features/events/close.js`. The close observation is created but without residual/recovery data. This means recovery windows (REC-1) have no data to compute from for move-closed events.

**Spec:** §1 Step 3 close-out panel: date, time, residual height, recovery min/max. §9 Event close: residual height, recovery days.
**Impact:** REC-1 recovery window calc cannot function without these inputs. Location picker "Recovering" section (OI-0008) also depends on this.

---

### OI-0041 — Move Wizard Missing Pre-Graze Observation Fields
**Added:** 2026-04-14 | **Area:** v2-build | **Priority:** P2
**Checkpoint:** post-CP-57
**Status:** open — DESIGN REQUIRED, do not build

V2_UX_FLOWS.md §1 Step 3 destination panel specifies pre-graze height and forage cover % fields. These are not present in the move wizard. The open observation is created but without forage height/cover data.

---

### OI-0042 — Health Recording: Group Session Mode Not Implemented
**Added:** 2026-04-14 | **Area:** v2-build | **Priority:** P3
**Checkpoint:** post-CP-57
**Status:** open — DESIGN REQUIRED, do not build

V2_UX_FLOWS.md §14 specifies group session mode for Weight, BCS, and Treatment recording (iterate through animals in a group). This is not implemented — health recording is single-animal only. No advance-to-next or group iteration pattern in weight.js, bcs.js, or treatment.js.

---

### OI-0043 — Field Mode Tile Navigation Targets Incorrect
**Added:** 2026-04-14 | **Area:** v2-build | **Priority:** P2
**Checkpoint:** post-CP-57
**Status:** open

V2_UX_FLOWS.md §16 specifies "Feed Animals" tile opens the Feed Delivery sheet (§4 loop) and "Harvest" tile opens the Harvest Recording sheet (§10). Implementation navigates to `#/events` and `#/feed` respectively — these go to full screen views, not the specific sheets. The spec intends direct-to-action tiles, not screen navigation.

**Fix:** Requires a sheet-opening mechanism callable from field mode (currently sheets are opened from within their parent screens). May need an event bus or direct sheet render.

---

### OI-0044 — Remaining i18n Hardcoded Strings (6 low-priority)
**Added:** 2026-04-14 | **Area:** v2-build | **Priority:** P4
**Checkpoint:** post-CP-57
**Status:** closed — fixed 2026-04-14

All 28 i18n violations fixed. Final 6: mobile-events-screen.js detail summary, reports/reference-console.js title, rotation-calendar/toolbar.js add button, settings parity reports, amendments/entry.js currency display.

---

### OI-0045 — Dead Export: daysBetweenExact() in date-utils.js
**Added:** 2026-04-14 | **Area:** v2-build | **Priority:** P4
**Checkpoint:** post-CP-57
**Status:** open

`src/utils/date-utils.js` exports `daysBetweenExact()` which is never imported or called anywhere. Companion `daysBetweenInclusive()` is used. Consider removing dead export.

---

### OI-0039 — §2.25 Spec Text Describes Per-Element Rows but Schema Uses Single Row
**Added:** 2026-04-14 | **Closed:** 2026-04-14 | **Area:** v2-design | **Priority:** P3
**Checkpoint:** CP-57
**Status:** closed — spec updated 2026-04-14

**Resolution:** V2_MIGRATION_PLAN.md §2.25 rewritten to match the implemented schema: one row per effective date with three price columns (`n_price_per_kg`, `p_price_per_kg`, `k_price_per_kg`), not three rows with an `element` discriminator. Code was already correct. Spec-only fix.

---

### OI-0037 — CP-57 Drift: schema_version hardcoded instead of imported from backup-import.js
**Added:** 2026-04-14 | **Area:** v2-build | **Priority:** P1
**Checkpoint:** CP-57
**Status:** closed — fixed 2026-04-14

**What is wrong:** `src/data/v1-migration.js` defines its own `CURRENT_SCHEMA_VERSION = 14` constant. §2.8 says "Read dynamically — same constant or derivation that CP-55 export uses per §5.11." If a new migration lands, v1-migration.js would retain stale value.

**Spec violated:** V2_MIGRATION_PLAN.md §2.8 (`schema_version` row) and §1.6 (`schema_version: current build's schema version (read dynamically per §5.11)`).

**Correct behavior:** Import `CURRENT_SCHEMA_VERSION` from `backup-import.js` (the single source of truth) instead of declaring a duplicate constant.

**Files affected:** `src/data/v1-migration.js`

---

### OI-0038 — CP-57 Drift: auto-backup not skipped for empty operations per §1.6
**Added:** 2026-04-14 | **Area:** v2-build | **Priority:** P2
**Checkpoint:** CP-57
**Status:** closed — fixed 2026-04-14

**What is wrong:** `src/features/settings/v1-import.js` calls `importOperationBackup()` unconditionally. §1.6 says "CP-57 skips the auto-backup step when the target operation has no existing data." On first migration an empty operation produces a useless auto-backup download.

**Spec violated:** V2_MIGRATION_PLAN.md §1.6 (CP-57 Architecture — CP-56 steps that CP-57 skips).

**Correct behavior:** Add a `skipAutoBackup` option to `importOperationBackup()`. CP-57 passes `skipAutoBackup: true` when the target operation is empty (no events, animals, or locations). CP-56's own import path never sets it.

**Files affected:** `src/data/backup-import.js`, `src/features/settings/v1-import.js`, `src/data/v1-migration.js`

---

### OI-0036 — Remove v1 Import Option from Settings After Cutover
**Added:** 2026-04-14 | **Area:** v2-build | **Priority:** P4
**Checkpoint:** post-cutover
**Status:** open — deferred until v2 is live and v1 migration is complete

The "Import from v1" option in Settings → Import (CP-57) is a one-time migration tool. After Tim has migrated, verified data, and gone live in v2, the v1 import entry point should be removed from the UI. Not urgent — it does no harm sitting there — but it's cleanup that keeps Settings tidy.

**Fix:** Remove the "Import from v1" button/section from the Settings → Import screen. Delete or gate the migration transform code behind a feature flag or remove entirely. One PR after cutover is confirmed.

---

### OI-0020 — Calc Reference Console Destination (Reports → Settings)
**Added:** 2026-04-13 | **Area:** v2-design → v2-build | **Priority:** P3
**Checkpoint:** post-CP-54 (future)

The Calc Reference console (renders all registered formulas grouped by domain) currently lives in Reports and is reached as a tab alongside the six report tabs listed in §4.6. It is a developer/audit surface, not a user-facing report. The right long-term home is **Settings → Developer** (or equivalent), which keeps Reports focused on user-facing analytics.

**Why defer:** moving it now expands CP-54 scope. Reports already renders it; no user-visible regression by leaving it there one CP longer. The Settings surface for this doesn't yet have a design.

**Fix path:**
1. Design a Settings → Developer (or Settings → Advanced) section that houses the calc reference (and any other admin/diagnostic surfaces).
2. Move the console render from Reports to the new Settings section.
3. Remove the tab from Reports; update §4.6 to list exactly the 6 tabs with no "plus Calc Reference" aside.
4. Grep and delete any `#/reports/reference` routes.

**Out of scope for CP-54.** Claude Code should leave the reference console in Reports for this checkpoint.

---

### OI-0012 — Calc Test Coverage Gap
**Added:** 2026-04-13 | **Area:** v2-build | **Priority:** P2
**Checkpoint:** CP-45/CP-46/CP-47
**Status:** closed — fixed 2026-04-14

Added 29 targeted tests to `tests/unit/calcs.test.js` (13 → 42 total): DMI-1 residual-by-date regression (3 tests), DMI-2 lactation branching beef vs dairy (3 tests), DMI-5 interpolation (2 tests), FED-1 residual percentage (3 tests), CST-1 feed cost (2 tests), CST-2 batch unit cost (2 tests), CST-3 NPK value (2 tests), REC-1 strip graze independent recovery (1 test). All requested coverage gaps addressed.

---

### OI-0013 — Reference Console Description Spot-Check
**Added:** 2026-04-13 | **Area:** v2-build | **Priority:** P2
**Checkpoint:** CP-45/CP-46/CP-47
**Status:** closed — fixed 2026-04-14

Audited all 37 `registerCalc()` calls across 4 files (core.js, feed-forage.js, advanced.js, capacity.js) against V2_CALCULATION_SPEC.md §4. Found 1 mismatch: CST-2 description said "cost_total / quantity_original" but spec says "bidirectional" — corrected. All other 36 descriptions match (some code descriptions add clarifying detail beyond the spec, which is acceptable).

---

### OI-0008 — CP-17: Location Picker Recovery Section Always Empty
**Added:** 2026-04-12 | **Area:** v2-build | **Priority:** P3
**Checkpoint:** CP-17

Acceptance criteria says "Location picker with Ready/**Recovering**/In Use/Confinement sections." The Recovering section is never shown because recovery status requires `paddock_observations` with recovery_min_days/recovery_max_days data, which doesn't exist yet. All non-in-use land locations appear as "Ready."

**Blocked by:** Paddock observations (OI-0007) and Phase 3.3 observation fields. Once observations are created with recovery data, this section can be populated. Code comment exists at `events/index.js` line 385.

## Closed

### OI-0035 — Schema Version Bump Convention Not Spec'd
**Added:** 2026-04-14 | **Closed:** 2026-04-14 | **Area:** v2-design / v2-build
**Resolution:** Convention defined and codified in two places: (1) **V2_MIGRATION_PLAN.md §5.11a** — new subsection "Schema Version Bump Convention" specifying that every new migration SQL ends with `UPDATE operations SET schema_version = N;` and adds a `BACKUP_MIGRATIONS` entry (no-op is fine: `N-1: (b) => { b.schema_version = N; return b; }`), plus update §5.3/§5.3a if the migration adds a table or FK. (2) **CLAUDE.md Code Quality Check #6** — enforced at commit time, same three requirements. Principle: "always do it, no judgment calls" — removes the need for case-by-case assessment of whether a migration changes backup shape.

---

### OI-0034 — CP-57 §2.7 Unparseable-Dose Audit Report Surface
**Added:** 2026-04-13 | **Closed:** 2026-04-14 | **Area:** v2-design
**Resolution:** Downloaded CSV file. Format: one row per unparseable dose (animal tag, date, raw dose text, treatment_type, notes). Downloaded automatically at end of migration alongside the summary screen. V2_MIGRATION_PLAN.md §1.4 (Audit Report) and §2.7 updated to specify CSV download surface.

---

### OI-0033 — CP-57 §2.23 Calculation Parity Check — Promote to Formal AC
**Added:** 2026-04-13 | **Closed:** 2026-04-14 | **Area:** v2-design
**Resolution:** Promoted to formal CP-57 acceptance criterion. NPK parity check: v1 stored NPK per event vs v2 on-read NPK calc, flag deltas >1% in the audit report. V2_MIGRATION_PLAN.md §1.4 updated with parity check bullet. Reference in §2.23 retained.

---

### OI-0032 — CP-57 Architecture: Reuse of CP-56 Import Pipeline
**Added:** 2026-04-13 | **Closed:** 2026-04-14 | **Area:** v2-design
**Resolution:** Confirmed: CP-57 reads v1 JSON → applies 24 transforms → produces a v2-shaped backup envelope (same format as CP-55) → feeds into CP-56 import pipeline. Gets FK-ordering (§5.3a), parity check, and migration chain for free. Auto-backup step skipped when target operation is empty (one-off migration, nothing to back up). `schema_version` in synthesized envelope set to current. Documented in new **V2_MIGRATION_PLAN.md §1.6** (CP-57 Architecture).

---

### OI-0031 — CP-57 Tool UX: Where Does the Migration Tool Live?
**Added:** 2026-04-13 | **Closed:** 2026-04-14 | **Area:** v2-design
**Resolution:** Settings → Import, alongside CP-56's "Import backup." Labeled "Import from v1." File upload (v1 JSON export). Re-run allowed (user can retry after failed attempt). Documented in new **V2_MIGRATION_PLAN.md §1.7** (CP-57 Tool UX). Post-cutover cleanup: OI-0036 added to remove the v1 import option after migration is complete.

---

### OI-0030 — CP-57 §1 Missing: v1 Export JSON Shape
**Added:** 2026-04-13 | **Closed:** 2026-04-14 | **Area:** v2-design
**Resolution:** Option (a) — snapshot v1 export shape into v2 docs. New **V2_MIGRATION_PLAN.md §1.5** documents the complete v1 `S` object: 26 arrays (events, paddocks, animals, groups, etc.), objects/scalars (users, operationSettings, settings sub-fields), each with §2 transform cross-reference. Pulled from v1's `ensureDataArrays()` in index.html and ARCHITECTURE.md data model section.

---

### OI-0029 — CP-57 §2.14 animal_classes — Verify Rename/Splits Alignment
**Added:** 2026-04-13 | **Closed:** 2026-04-14 | **Area:** v2-design
**Resolution:** Verified against `supabase/migrations/003_d3_animals_groups.sql`. §2.14 field list matches current schema. Added `archived = false` row to §2.14 for all migrated classes (column exists in schema, not previously in the transform spec). No rename/split drift found — the "rename/splits" noted in CLAUDE.md referred to earlier design iteration, not a code-level divergence.

---

### OI-0028 — CP-57 §2 Missing Transform: npk_price_history
**Added:** 2026-04-13 | **Closed:** 2026-04-14 | **Area:** v2-design
**Resolution:** v1 tracks only current NPK prices (not history) in `operation_settings` JSONB (`nPrice`/`pPrice`/`kPrice`). Migration creates one `npk_price_history` row per element (N, P, K) with `effective_date = migration date` and current prices converted from $/lb to $/kg. New **V2_MIGRATION_PLAN.md §2.25** (npk_price_history) documents the transform. Tim confirmed current values with migration date as first record is the right approach.

---

### OI-0027 — CP-57 §2.24 user_preferences.active_farm_id Default for Migrated Prefs
**Added:** 2026-04-13 | **Closed:** 2026-04-14 | **Area:** v2-design
**Resolution:** Added `active_farm_id = NULL` to V2_MIGRATION_PLAN.md §2.24 user_preferences transform. Puts migrated user in "All farms" mode; they can pick an active farm after migration. v1 has no multi-farm concept. One-line spec update.

---

### OI-0026 — CP-57 §2.8 operations.schema_version Stamp During Migration
**Added:** 2026-04-13 | **Closed:** 2026-04-14 | **Area:** v2-design
**Resolution:** Added row to V2_MIGRATION_PLAN.md §2.8 operations transform table: `schema_version | Set to current schema version at time of migration. Read dynamically per §5.11.` Ensures migrated operations get the correct stamp for subsequent backups/imports.

---

### OI-0025 — CP-57 §2.7 Animal Notes Routing: animal_notes Table vs animals.notes Field
**Added:** 2026-04-13 | **Closed:** 2026-04-14 | **Area:** v2-design
**Resolution:** v1 type='note' health events → `animal_notes` table rows (one per note, `noted_at` from health event date). v1 `animals.notes` (free text field) stays as-is in `animals.notes` — not moved to `animal_notes`. V2_MIGRATION_PLAN.md §2.7 rewritten with updated notes routing. Tim confirmed: not many notes, so the clean one-per-row approach works.

---

### OI-0024 — CP-57 §2.3 event_paddock_windows Strip Graze Defaults
**Added:** 2026-04-13 | **Closed:** 2026-04-13 | **Area:** v2-design
**Resolution:** Added paragraph to V2_MIGRATION_PLAN.md §2.3 specifying full-paddock defaults for all migrated paddock windows: `is_strip_graze = false`, `strip_group_id = NULL`, `area_pct = 100`. Verified against migration 005 (`is_strip_graze DEFAULT false`, `area_pct DEFAULT 100 CHECK > 0 AND <= 100`) and V2_SCHEMA_DESIGN.md §5.2 — DB defaults match the migration values, but the spec sets them explicitly for clarity. v1 has no strip graze concept; users wanting strip graze on previously-migrated events would close and re-create. Note: `area_pct = 100` confirmed as the "full paddock" value (not NULL).

---

### OI-0023 — CP-57 §2.2 events.source_event_id Default for Migrated Events
**Added:** 2026-04-13 | **Closed:** 2026-04-13 | **Area:** v2-design
**Resolution:** Added line to V2_MIGRATION_PLAN.md §2.2 events transform table: `source_event_id | NULL for all migrated events. New in v2 (GH-5, migration 014) — links cross-farm moves. v1 has no equivalent; all migrated events are origin events.` No design discussion needed — v1 has no cross-farm move concept.

---

### OI-0021 — CP-56 Transaction Strategy (Atomic Restore)
**Added:** 2026-04-13 | **Closed:** 2026-04-13 | **Area:** v2-design
**Resolution:** **Option B — per-table client-side replace in FK-dependency order, with halt-on-first-failure.** No Postgres stored procedure. Rationale: the payload-size ceiling on Supabase `rpc` (~50 MB even with bumped limits) would force chunking for real operations, and chunked RPC is not atomic across chunks either — so Option A gives atomicity in dev and a fake promise in production. Option B keeps the implementation surface smaller (no SQL function to maintain in lockstep with schema changes), fails loudly at the specific table/row that violated, and is safe because the auto-backup file from OI-0022 is the rollback mechanism. Decision locked in V2_MIGRATION_PLAN.md §5.7.6 (wholesale replace, halt, reference §5.3a for order). FK-ordering authoritative list added as new §5.3a with two-pass pattern for `animals` and `events` self-references. CLAUDE.md "Known Traps" updated with FK-ordering rule pointing at §5.3a.

### OI-0022 — CP-56 Revert Safety Net (24h Stash Mechanism)
**Added:** 2026-04-13 | **Closed:** 2026-04-13 | **Area:** v2-design
**Resolution:** **Auto-downloaded pre-import backup file.** Before the destructive replace runs, CP-56 calls the CP-55 export path to produce a fresh backup of the current operation state and triggers a browser download named `gtho-v2-auto-backup-before-restore__{slug}__{timestamp}__schema-v{N}.json`. Revert = re-import that file via the normal import flow. No in-app stash, no localStorage quota problem, no IndexedDB surface, no Supabase side table. If the auto-backup fails to produce (sync pending, offline, download blocked, disk full), CP-56 halts before the destructive replace — the import does not proceed without a safety net. Decision locked in V2_MIGRATION_PLAN.md §5.7.4 (step 4 of import procedure) and new §5.7a (Revert Mechanism — Design Decision) covering rationale, tradeoffs, and failure modes.

### OI-0019 — No Logout Affordance in Header (v1 Parity)
**Added:** 2026-04-13 | **Closed:** 2026-04-13 | **Area:** v2-design → v2-build
**Resolution:** Designed alongside OI-0015 since they share the same header real estate. User menu button (circle with initials) added to right cluster; tap opens popover with user email and Log Out. Logout triggers confirm dialog only when unsynced writes exist in the queue. Field Mode exits first before logout. Full spec: `github/issues/header-redesign-and-multi-farm-context.md`.

---

### OI-0015 — Header Shows Farm Name, Needs Operation Name + Farm Picker
**Added:** 2026-04-13 | **Closed:** 2026-04-13 | **Area:** v2-design → v2-build
**Resolution:** Full design locked. Key decisions: (1) `user_preferences.active_farm_id uuid NULL` — per-user, syncs across devices, null = "All farms" mode; (2) "All farms" mode supported — farm-scoped screens aggregate with per-record farm chips; (3) switch-with-unsaved-work shows a confirm dialog (Switch anyway / Cancel), drafts stay tied to their source farm; (4) active farm scopes display, not permissions — wizards include a **farm chip** at the top of destination pickers so cross-farm moves work without context switching; (5) **no event straddles farms** — whole-group cross-farm moves close the source event and open a new event linked by `events.source_event_id`; (6) individual animal cross-farm moves are membership edits only, no new event; (7) **build stamp restored** to header right cluster for testing diagnostics; (8) event cards render directional markers ("← from {farm}" / "→ to {farm}") when `source_event_id` links to an event on a different farm. Doc updates applied to V2_SCHEMA_DESIGN.md (§1.5, §5.1), V2_UX_FLOWS.md (§1, §17.2, new §18), V2_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md (§3.6). Full spec: `github/issues/header-redesign-and-multi-farm-context.md`.

---

### OI-0017 — Product Add Dialog Missing Unit Selection
**Added:** 2026-04-13 | **Closed:** 2026-04-13 | **Area:** v2-build
**Resolution:** Added unit selection (from `inputProductUnits`) to the input product create/edit sheet in `src/features/amendments/reference-tables.js`. Saves `unitId` on the product. Unit name shown in product list. Feed type sheet already had a unit selector (bale/ton/kg/lb). Treatment recording sheet already had dose unit selector. The gap was only on amendment input products.

---

### OI-0018 — Sync Status Not Shown in App Header
**Added:** 2026-04-13 | **Closed:** 2026-04-13 | **Area:** v2-build
**Resolution:** Added compact sync indicator to `src/ui/header.js` — dot-based (sync-ok/sync-pending/sync-err/sync-off classes from existing §3.14 design tokens). Reads from `getSyncAdapter().getStatus()`. Tap navigates to `#/settings`. CSS button in `.header-sync-btn`. No duplicate logic — reuses existing store sync state.

---

### OI-0016 — Dose Units: No Add/Edit UI
**Added:** 2026-04-13 | **Closed:** 2026-04-13 | **Area:** v2-build
**Resolution:** Added dose unit CRUD to `src/features/health/reference-tables.js` — add/edit sheet, archive action, list with testids. Follows existing category/type pattern. No schema change needed (table exists). Seed data preserved; users can now extend.

---

### OI-0014 — Event Close Manure Transaction volumeKg Placeholder
**Added:** 2026-04-13 | **Closed:** 2026-04-13 | **Area:** v2-build
**Resolution:** Verified architecturally sound. `volumeKg=0` is a deliberate placeholder — the stored record links the event to the manure batch for tracing. Real volume requires NPK-1 calc inputs (excretion_rate × avg_weight × head_count × duration × capture_pct). Reports will compute at display time via NPK-1, not from the stored column. Code comment updated in `close.js` to document this decision. No functional change needed until Phase 3.4 amendments reports are built — re-verify when writing that display path.

---

### OI-0011 — Feed Screen Metrics Still Show Placeholders
**Added:** 2026-04-13 | **Closed:** 2026-04-13 | **Area:** v2-build
**Resolution:** Wired DM on hand (sum batch.remaining × dm_pct for non-archived batches), daily run rate (average daily DM delivered over 30 days from event_feed_entries), and days on hand (DM on hand ÷ run rate) into feed day goal banner. Progress bar threshold coloring now works. Three stat cells added below the heading. Unit-aware via display().

---

### OI-0001 — Strip Grazing: Partial Paddock Windows
**Added:** 2026-04-12 | **Closed:** 2026-04-13 | **Area:** v2-design
**Resolution:** Design integrated into main docs. Schema (V2_SCHEMA_DESIGN.md §5.2 event_paddock_windows) has `is_strip_graze`, `strip_group_id`, `area_pct`. Calc spec (V2_CALCULATION_SPEC.md) NPK-3, FOR-1, REC-1 updated for effective strip area. UX flows (V2_UX_FLOWS.md) §1.4 (move wizard strip graze option), §2.4 (advance strip action), §11 (event card strip progress) all documented. Design system §3.15 covers strip grazing progress component. Decision logged as A45 in V2_BUILD_INDEX.md. Spec remains at `github/issues/strip-grazing-paddock-windows.md` for Claude Code when this work is picked up during the rotation calendar (CP-54) or a dedicated checkpoint.

---

### OI-0002 — Unit System: No Schema Column
**Added:** 2026-04-12 | **Closed:** 2026-04-13 | **Area:** v2-build
**Resolution:** Design decision made: unit system lives on `operations` (operation-wide, same rationale as currency). Schema amended — `operations.unit_system text NOT NULL DEFAULT 'imperial' CHECK IN ('metric','imperial')`. Decision logged as A44 in V2_BUILD_INDEX.md. V2_INFRASTRUCTURE.md §1.3 added. V2_MIGRATION_PLAN.md §2.8 updated. Implementation spec written: `github/issues/unit-system-operations-migration.md` — includes localStorage → operation migration path, full list of unit-sensitive settings that must re-render on toggle, and input field conversion behavior.

---

### OI-0009 — Desktop Layout: Nav Sidebar Overlaps Main Content
**Added:** 2026-04-13 | **Closed:** 2026-04-13 | **Area:** v2-build
**Resolution:** Added `grid-column: 2` to `.app-content` in the `@media (min-width: 900px)` block of `src/styles/main.css`. This places the main content in the `1fr` column (right side), while the fixed nav covers the 220px left column. GH issue #1.

---

### OI-0010 — Dashboard Home Screen Not Rendering Per v1 / Missing §17 Implementation
**Added:** 2026-04-13 | **Closed:** 2026-04-13 | **Area:** v2-build
**Resolution:** Complete rebuild of dashboard per V2_UX_FLOWS.md §17. Header bar updated to show farm name. Farm overview stats row (5-metric desktop, 3-metric mobile with threshold colors). Period selector pills (24h/3d/7d/30d/All). View toggle (Groups/Locations, default locations for new users). Group cards with composition line, location status bar, DMI progress, NPK deposited, action buttons (Move/Place/Weights/Edit), and collapse/expand on mobile. Location cards with active events by location, group lists, feed status, strip graze info, and unplaced groups section. Open tasks section (4 compact todo cards + Add task + All tasks link). Survey draft card (conditional). Weaning nudge (conditional). Mobile bottom nav (7 items, fixed bottom). Todos feature UI created: `src/features/todos/` with todo list screen (`#/todos` route), 3-axis filter bar (status/user/location), todo create/edit sheet, todo card component (compact + full modes). Todos nav entry with red badge (open count) on both desktop sidebar and mobile bottom nav. GH issue #2.

### OI-0003 — Animal Notes: No Schema Table
**Added:** 2026-04-12 | **Closed:** 2026-04-12 | **Area:** v2-design
**Resolution:** Option A — add `animal_notes` table (id, operation_id, animal_id, noted_at, note, created_at, updated_at). Tim confirmed animals need notes. Schema amendment needed in V2_SCHEMA_DESIGN.md D9. V2_UX_FLOWS.md §14.8 updated to remove pending-decision language.

### OI-0004 — CP-22: Pull/Merge from Supabase Not Implemented
**Added:** 2026-04-12 | **Closed:** 2026-04-12 | **Area:** v2-build
**Resolution:** Built sync registry (`src/data/sync-registry.js`) mapping all 50 entity types to table names + `fromSupabaseShape`. Added `mergeRemote()` to store (remote wins when `updated_at` newer, 5 unit tests). Added `pullAllRemote()` orchestrator (`src/data/pull-remote.js`). Wired into boot (flush queue then pull) and reconnect (window 'online' → flush then pull).

### OI-0006 — CP-18: Advance Strip Button Not Rendered
**Added:** 2026-04-12 | **Closed:** 2026-04-12 | **Area:** v2-build
**Resolution:** Advance Strip button now renders on event cards when any paddock window has `isStripGraze=true` and is open. Sheet has two phases: close current strip (date/time) + open next strip (date/time). "End strip early" closes without opening next. Strip progress label shows "Strip N of M — Location". Creates close + open observations. Forage fields deferred to Phase 3.3. Strip progress bar visualization (§3.15) deferred — label only for now.

---

### OI-0007 — CP-17/18/20: Paddock Observations Not Created
**Added:** 2026-04-12 | **Closed:** 2026-04-12 | **Area:** v2-build
**Resolution:** Added `createObservation()` helper. Observations now created at all 5 locations: event creation (open), sub-move open (open), sub-move close (close), move wizard (close per source window + open for destination), event close (close per window). Forage height/cover/quality fields remain null until Phase 3.3 populates them.

### OI-0005 — CP-23: E2E Test Has Wrong Selectors and Was Never Run
**Added:** 2026-04-12 | **Closed:** 2026-04-12 | **Area:** v2-build
**Resolution:** Fixed 3 onboarding selector mismatches (`onboarding-op-name` → `onboarding-operation-name`, `onboarding-next` → step-specific `onboarding-next-1/2/3`, `.onboarding` → `[data-testid="onboarding-wizard"]`). Changed auth flow from signup to login (Supabase rejects fake email domains). Added `beforeAll` guard requiring E2E_EMAIL/E2E_PASSWORD env vars. All 35 selectors verified against source. Playwright browsers confirmed installed. Test requires pre-created Supabase auth account to run.

## Change Log

| Date | Session | Changes |
|------|---------|---------|
| 2026-04-13 | Strip grazing + unit system integration | OI-0001 closed — strip grazing design integrated into V2_SCHEMA_DESIGN.md, V2_CALCULATION_SPEC.md, V2_UX_FLOWS.md, V2_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md; A45 logged. OI-0002 closed — `operations.unit_system` column added to schema; A44 logged; V2_INFRASTRUCTURE.md §1.3 added; V2_MIGRATION_PLAN.md §2.8 updated; implementation spec written to `github/issues/unit-system-operations-migration.md` covering entity update, store action, settings re-render on toggle, onboarding selector, and localStorage → operation migration. |
| 2026-04-13 | Pre-CP-54 audit + nits | Added OI-0011 (feed metrics placeholders, P2), OI-0012 (calc test gap, P2), OI-0013 (calc reference descriptions spot-check, P2), OI-0014 (event close manure volumeKg placeholder, P3) from audit. Added Tim nits: OI-0015 (header: operation name + farm picker, P2, DESIGN REQUIRED), OI-0016 (dose units CRUD, P3), OI-0017 (product add dialog missing unit selection, P2), OI-0018 (sync status not in app header, P2), OI-0019 (no logout affordance in header — v1 parity regression, P2). |
| 2026-04-13 | Header + multi-farm context design | OI-0015 closed — full design locked for header redesign (operation name + farm picker + user menu + build stamp) and multi-farm context (active_farm_id, "All farms" mode, cross-farm move pattern, no-straddling-events rule, source_event_id linkage). OI-0019 closed — bundled into same design (user menu popover with Log Out). Spec written to `github/issues/header-redesign-and-multi-farm-context.md`. Doc updates applied to V2_SCHEMA_DESIGN.md §1.5 and §5.1 (two new columns), V2_UX_FLOWS.md §17.2 (rewritten), §1 (farm chip on pickers), new §18 (farm switching), V2_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md §3.6 (extended with farm picker + user menu patterns). |
| 2026-04-13 | Rotation calendar design (CP-54) | Full design locked for CP-54. Major scope expansion from the original CP-54 row (month-columns × AUDS-colored-cells) to a continuous zoomable timeline with two view modes (Estimated Status + DM Forecast), linked-paddock rendering, proportional strip-graze bands, sub-move connectors, never-grazed tan capacity blocks with survey CTA, right-hand sidebar aligned 1:1 with the paddock column, two toolbar lightboxes (Timeline Selection + Dry Matter Forecaster), Show Confinement Locations on/off pill, and a mode indicator pill in the header. Calendar lives only on the Events screen — Reports → Rotation Calendar tab removed (Reports tab strip trimmed to 6: Feed & DMI Trends first). Mobile fallback: no calendar below 900px, mobile Events uses the v1 GRZ-11 banner + GRZ-10 events log pattern. List view on Events reuses v1 GRZ-10 event log. Doc updates: V2_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md §4.3 (Events rewritten), §4.6 (Rotation Calendar tab removed). V2_BUILD_INDEX.md CP-54 row rewritten with full acceptance criteria. V2_UX_FLOWS.md new §19 Rotation Calendar (8 subsections, Events-only). V2_CALCULATION_SPEC.md gained FOR-6 (Forecast Standing DM at Date) in the Forage domain and new §4.11 Capacity Forecast domain with CAP-1 (Period Capacity Coverage); formula count 35 → 37. OI-0001 (strip grazing) now explicitly bundled into CP-54 per the closure note. CP-54 implementation spec pending (next step this session). |
| 2026-04-13 | CP-54 pre-build reconciliation (Claude Code audit) | Added OI-0020 (Calc Reference console destination — Reports vs Settings, P3). GH-6 spec updated: calc file paths corrected to `src/calcs/feed-forage.js` (FOR-6) and new `src/calcs/capacity.js` (CAP-1) — not feature dirs, matching the existing 35-formula pattern; Reports cleanup reworded from "remove Rotation Calendar tab" (never built in code) to "confirm §4.6 alignment by adding Pasture Surveys + Weaning placeholder tabs"; Reference console left in Reports for this CP per OI-0020. V2_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md §4.6 updated to reflect reality: Calc Reference renders alongside the 6 report tabs in v2.0, planned destination Settings → Developer (OI-0020). No CP-54 build impact. |
| 2026-04-13 | CP-56 spec draft (while CP-55 in flight) | Drafted `github/issues/cp-56-import-json-restore.md` extracting acceptance criteria from V2_MIGRATION_PLAN.md §5.7–§5.9 and V2_UX_FLOWS.md §20.3. Surfaced two blocking design gaps as open items: **OI-0021** (transaction strategy — Postgres `rpc` stored procedure vs client-side per-table replace, P1, DESIGN REQUIRED) and **OI-0022** (revert safety net — 24h stash mechanism is referenced in §5.7.6 but undesigned; localStorage ~5MB budget likely insufficient for real operation backups, P1, DESIGN REQUIRED). Both OIs block CP-56 implementation; spec file references them explicitly in the "Blocked by open design questions" section. |
| 2026-04-13 | CP-56 design decisions locked + FK-ordering added | **OI-0021 closed** — picked per-table client-side replace with halt-on-first-failure (Option B); skipped Postgres `rpc` because payload size ceiling forces chunking which breaks atomicity in production anyway. **OI-0022 closed** — picked auto-downloaded pre-import backup file as the revert mechanism; skipped localStorage/IndexedDB/Supabase-side-table options because size-safe, durable, and reuses CP-55 code. Third issue Tim flagged: parent/child FK ordering was missing from the spec (same class of bug that burned v1). Added **new V2_MIGRATION_PLAN.md §5.3a** — authoritative FK-dependency insert/delete order for all 49 included tables, with two-pass pattern for self-referential tables (`animals`, `events`). V2_MIGRATION_PLAN.md §5.7 rewritten with 10 numbered steps; new §5.7a documents the revert mechanism rationale. CLAUDE.md "Known Traps" gained an FK-ordering entry pointing at §5.3a. CP-56 spec file slimmed to a thin pointer to the base docs — one source of truth per Tim's direction. |
| 2026-04-13 | CP-57 reconciliation — OI-0023 closed | **OI-0023 closed** — V2_MIGRATION_PLAN.md §2.2 events transform table gained `source_event_id = NULL` line. v1 has no cross-farm move concept; all migrated events are origin events. One-line spec update, no design discussion needed. |
| 2026-04-14 | CP-57 reconciliation — OI-0035 added | **OI-0035 added** — schema_version bump convention not spec'd. Surfaced during OI-0026 walkthrough: no doc enforces that each new migration SQL bumps `operations.schema_version` or adds a `BACKUP_MIGRATIONS` entry. P1 because it affects all future schema changes, not just CP-57. Separate from the CP-57 reconciliation set. |
| 2026-04-13 | CP-57 reconciliation — OI-0024 closed | **OI-0024 closed** — V2_MIGRATION_PLAN.md §2.3 gained a "Strip grazing columns (A45 — new in v2)" paragraph specifying `is_strip_graze = false`, `strip_group_id = NULL`, `area_pct = 100` for all migrated windows. Verified DB defaults in migration 005 and V2_SCHEMA_DESIGN.md §5.2 match the migration values; spec sets them explicitly anyway. Confirmed `area_pct = 100` represents full paddock. |
| 2026-04-14 | CP-57 reconciliation — batch closure (OI-0025 through OI-0035) | Closed 11 OIs in batch: **OI-0025** (animal notes → `animal_notes` rows), **OI-0026** (schema_version stamp in §2.8), **OI-0027** (active_farm_id = NULL in §2.24), **OI-0028** (npk_price_history transform — new §2.25), **OI-0029** (animal_classes verified, added `archived = false` to §2.14), **OI-0030** (v1 export shape — new §1.5), **OI-0031** (migration tool UX — new §1.7), **OI-0032** (CP-56 pipeline reuse — new §1.6), **OI-0033** (NPK parity check promoted to AC in §1.4), **OI-0034** (unparseable dose audit → CSV download in §1.4 + §2.7), **OI-0035** (schema version bump convention — new §5.11a + CLAUDE.md check #6). Added **OI-0036** (remove v1 import after cutover, P4, deferred). V2_MIGRATION_PLAN.md gained 6 edits (§1.4, §1.5, §1.6, §1.7, §2.7, §2.8, §2.14, §2.24, §2.25, §5.11a). CLAUDE.md gained Code Quality Check #6. |
| 2026-04-13 | CP-57 pre-work — per-gap reconciliation OIs logged | Added **OI-0023** through **OI-0034** (12 items) covering every §1–§2 gap between V2_MIGRATION_PLAN.md and current schema/design. Split by concern: OI-0023 (events.source_event_id default), OI-0024 (strip graze defaults on paddock windows), OI-0025 (animal_notes routing — design required), OI-0026 (operations.schema_version stamp), OI-0027 (user_preferences.active_farm_id default), OI-0028 (npk_price_history transform — design required), OI-0029 (animal_classes rename/splits verification), OI-0030 (v1 export JSON shape — spec update), OI-0031 (CP-57 tool UX — design required), OI-0032 (reuse of CP-56 import pipeline — design required), OI-0033 (§2.23 parity check as formal AC), OI-0034 (§2.7 unparseable-dose audit surface — design required). Status tags distinguish SPEC UPDATE REQUIRED (obvious one-liners) from DESIGN REQUIRED (needs Tim's decision). To be walked through one at a time; each closure updates V2_MIGRATION_PLAN.md inline. CP-57 spec file in `github/issues/` written after all 12 close. |
